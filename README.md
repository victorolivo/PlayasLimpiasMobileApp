# PlayasLimpiasMobileApp
Mobile application with Xamarin.Forms

# MSSA Project#2: 'Playas Limpias Mobile App'
Dove into mobile development this time. I really enjoyed and learned a lot making this project.

# Concept
The #project is a "Beach Rescue app", anyone with the app can report a coastline in need, and create events to gather volunteers and rescue said area. (Trash cleanup from natural resources mainly)

# Idea Origin
I used to spend most of my free time at the beach, it always annoyed me that some people leave lots of trash behind. Even though I was part of some non-profits that perform rescue events, they weren't as frequent or on-demand.

# Technologies
This project was created with Xamarin Forms, SQLite, and the Xamarin Community Library.
