# Playas Limpias Mobile Application

Mobile application with Xamarin.Forms. The project is a "Beach Rescue app", anyone with the app can report a coastline in need, and create events to gather volunteers and rescue said area. (Trash cleanup from natural resources mainly). This project was part of my MSSA project#2: 'Playas Limpias Mobile App'
Dove into mobile development this time. I really enjoyed and learned a lot making this project.

# Idea Origin

I used to spend most of my free time at the beach, it always annoyed me that some people leave lots of trash behind. Even though I was part of some non-profits that perform rescue events, they weren't as frequent or on-demand.

# Technologies

* Xamarin.Forms - MVVM
* C#
* Entity Framework
